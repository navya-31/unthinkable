# ðŸ“š Knowledge-base Search Engine (RAG)

## Description
This project is a **document-based search engine** that allows users to upload PDF or TXT files and ask questions about their content. It uses **vector embeddings** and **FAISS** for fast retrieval of relevant text chunks, and a **local language model (HuggingFace FLAN-T5 small)** to generate **clean, synthesized answers** in natural language.

The system ensures that:  
- Multiple documents can be uploaded at once  
- Relevant information is retrieved quickly from large documents  
- Answers are readable and concise  
- Fully offline operation â€” **no OpenAI API key needed**

**Use Cases:**  
- Students querying lecture notes or study materials  
- Professionals searching through reports or manuals  
- Any scenario where quick, accurate answers from documents are needed
